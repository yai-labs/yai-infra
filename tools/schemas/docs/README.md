# Docs Schemas (Canonical)

This directory is the canonical source for YAI docs schemas.

Consumer repos (including `yai`) may keep mirrored copies for local validation runtime,
but schema evolution must be proposed and reviewed in `yai-infra` first.

Mirror policy:
- canonical: `yai-infra/tools/schemas/docs/*`
- consumer mirror path: `<repo>/tools/schemas/docs/*`
