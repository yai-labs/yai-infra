{obj}

## Runbook Anchor
- `{rb_anchor}`

## Done When
- [ ] Phase issue is open and active for this milestone
- [ ] Required implementation PRs are merged
- [ ] Gate status is `Passed`
- [ ] MP Closure issue is completed and closed
- [ ] Evidence links are reviewable and reproducible

## Required MP
- `{mp_id}`

## Evidence Requirements
- [ ] Link all phase PRs (core/docs/specs/cli as needed)
- [ ] Attach gate results (CI logs / command output)
- [ ] Include proof-pack or verification artifacts (if applicable)
- [ ] Declare explicit close decision in MP Closure issue

- Phase: `{phase}`
- RB-ID: `{rb_id}`
- Milestone: `{canonical_milestone_title(track, phase)}`
- Runbook Anchor: `{rb_anchor}`
- Target MP-ID: `{mp_id}`

## Objective
Execute the runbook phase and keep all related work auditable and linked.

## Operational Checklist
- [ ] Confirm runbook scope and expected outputs
- [ ] Create/update linked implementation PRs
- [ ] Keep `track:*` and `phase:*` labels aligned across items
- [ ] Keep all phase items assigned to the phase milestone

## PRs To Produce
- [ ] Core/runtime PR
- [ ] Docs/governance PR
- [ ] Specs/CLI companion PRs (if required)

## Gate Status
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] Running
- [ ] Passed
- [ ] Failed

## Notes
- Use this issue as the operational source of truth.
- Closure authority is the MP Closure issue for the same phase.
