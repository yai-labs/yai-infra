# YAI Runtime API (Contracts)

These docs are generated from the public headers in this repo.
They describe runtime-facing contracts used by the root/kernel/engine layers.

Quick links:
- `kernel/`
- `engine/`
- `root/`
- `boot/`

Normative note:
If runtime code disagrees with `yai-specs`, the code is wrong.
