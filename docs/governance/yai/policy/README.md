# Docs Policy

This folder contains documentation governance rules.
Its function is to keep naming, structure, and writing quality consistent across contributors and agents.

## What belongs here

- global docs style
- structural conventions
- naming and formatting rules

## Canonical File

- `docs/_policy/docs-style.md`

## Why this matters

Without policy, documentation drifts into mixed style and mixed intent.
Policy keeps docs predictable for:
- maintainers,
- reviewers,
- automation and code agents.

## Boundary

Policy files define documentation behavior.
They do not define runtime contract or protocol law.
Normative law stays upstream in `deps/yai-specs/`.
