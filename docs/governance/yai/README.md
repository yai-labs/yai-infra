# YAI Governance Docs (Migrated)

This directory is the canonical location in `yai-infra` for governance/process documentation migrated from `yai`.

Moved from `yai`:
- `docs/dev-guide/` -> `docs/governance/yai/dev-guide/`
- `docs/templates/` -> `docs/governance/yai/templates/`
- `docs/_policy/` -> `docs/governance/yai/policy/`
- `docs/proof/` -> `docs/governance/yai/proof/`

Compatibility stubs remain in `yai` to preserve historical paths.
