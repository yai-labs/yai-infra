# GitHub Template Residency

Canonical GitHub templates for YAI repositories are owned by `yai-infra`:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE*`

Consumer repositories may keep local copies only as mirrors for GitHub UX
compatibility. Mirror drift is not allowed and must be enforced by CI checks
against `yai-infra` canonical templates.
